         <p>I have a subscription to Sky Sports enjoying watching football and cricket. I listen to music via the radio as I like the thought that the song selection is random. 
            I follow national current affairs via Sky News and read the local newspaper online. I enjoy using Microsoft Publisher, Paint 3D and Canva to create graphic design materials, 
            for example, cards, videos, and reports.</p>

<!--Overall notes
            I feel I have too many items and the whole CV needs a re-work
                I would have liked to list skills straight after the IT Qualifications but it did not look right due to having too many qualifications
